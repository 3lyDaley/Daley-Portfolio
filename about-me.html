                        Im Ely (they/them) but most often called 'E' for short. I grew up in both Houston, TX and 
                        Sioux Falls, SD. I landed in Oakland, CA in 2013 and now share a home here with my partner, 
                        a moody russian blue and a little senior dog. I recieved a BA in studio art with a minor 
                        in chemistry from Mills College in May 2021. Fun fact: I majored in physics and chemistry for two years before 
                        the switch to art! They really do go hand in hand. I still LOVE math & science and try to integrate 
                        them in my daily life as much as I can. I am being trained in full-stack web development through UC 
                        Berkeley Extension currently. Career-wise, I am passionate about combining my backround in the visual 
                        arts and my investment in the betterment of social conditions with the technical skills of web design to
                        inspire creative interaction with organizations working towards social and political change.
