                        Im Ely (they/them) but most often called 'E' for short. I grew up in both Houston, TX and 
                        Sioux Falls, SD. I landed in Oakland, CA in 2013 and now share a home here with my partner, 
                        a moody russian blue and a scruffy senior dog. I recieved a BA in studio art with a minor 
                        in chemistry from Mills College in May 2021. Fun fact: I majored in physics and chemistry for two years before 
                        the switch to art! Currently, I am being trained in full-stack web development through UC 
                        Berkeley Extension.
