                        Run Buddy is a homepage for a mock start-up with the intention to find
                        local runners and connect them to a run-buddy personal trainer. Client's 
                        request was to create an attractive webpage, complete with a contact form,
                        functioning navigational links to hop to specific areas of the page, and a 
                        separate page with the company's privacy policy. The site is equipped with 
                        mobile queries to ensure compatibility with screens of all sizes.
