## General Information
My (Ely's) portfolio's first working draft. The goal was to create something individually stylized, and to try and push my understanding of CSS 
through pseudoclasses and mobile-friendly amendments. The portfolio ultimately exists to showcase previous work and individual expression in the 
aesthetic of the portfolio itself. I intended to have the main stage, so to speak, be the graphic design, functionality, and accessibility of the portfolio itself, extended
by the previous, current, and future projects that will be added in the future. There is a contact page including links to my Github, LinkdIn, and email, and an about me page 
with an introductory paragraph & photo for further personalization.

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ 

## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Increasing negative space by converting to a scroll-down format rather than different pages.
- Increased user interactivity by adding backround and scroll animations.
- Add more buttons for pop-up information.
- Exploring more text options
- Animating images to hide/reveal.
- Website is in need of a footer.
