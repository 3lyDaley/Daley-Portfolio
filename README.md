## General Information
My (Ely's) portfolio's first working draft. The goal was to create something individually stylized, and to try and push my understanding of CSS 
through pseudoclasses and mobile-friendly amendments. The portfolio ultimately exists to showcase previous work and individual expression in the 
aesthetic of the portfolio itself. I intended to have the main stage, so to speak, be the graphic design, functionality, and accessibility of the portfolio itself, extended
by the previous, current, and future projects that will be added in the future. There is a contact page including links to my Github, LinkdIn, and email, and an about me page 
with an introductory paragraph & photo for further personalization.

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ 

## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Improving the layout of the "work" page, possibly full re-design to improve mobile functionality.
- The site could use some more user interactivity, one idea is to animate scrolling text on the about me page. 
- Possibly giving each "Work" project its own page. 
- Make the "Work" page a simple text list that anchors project pages to increase negative space and further allow for mobile finessing. 
- Possible reformatting, starting from a 575px viewport and working up from there.
